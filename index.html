<h1>Srdjan Marinovic</h1>
<h4>srdjan dot marinovic at gmail dot com</h4>

<p>I'm a computer scientist with experience in distributed graph analytics, authentication and authorization platforms, and 
    AI systems (both symbolic, deep learning, and LLMs).</p>

<p>My journey spans academic research at ETH Zurich and Imperial College London, co-founding
and scaling a graph analytics startup (acquired by PwC), and leading
enterprise-scale data and AI initiatives within PwC. Currently, I am the CTO at
<a href="https://futurae.com">Futurae</a> focusing on authentication and digital identity
products.</p>

<p>In my leadership roles, I focus
on building and mentoring high-performing engineering teams through
continuous delivery, fast deployments, and strong recovery procedures. We deliver
secure, reliable, and scalable systems that bridge the gap
between cutting-edge research and practical engineering solutions.</p>

<h2>Futurae</h2>

<p>As the CTO, I am working with Backend, SDK, QA, and Data teams on developing Futurae's authentication, trust signals,
and digital wallet products.</p>

<p> I am also collaborating very closely with the product and sales team on 
    shaping our strong anti-phishing offering and risk-based
authentications based on passkeys and ML models.</p>

<h2>PwC US</h2>

<p>As a Tech-and-Innovation Director, 
    I integrated the <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/products/signal-graph.html">Signal Graph</a> technology 
    from my startup (see below) into various PwC projects, 
    including <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/alliances/microsoft/azure/smart-venue/smart-venues-solution.html">Smart Venues</a> for IoT-driven venue management,
     and an organizational network analysis platform based on graph ML and LLMs.</p>
<p>
    I also worked on building tools to measure and improve ROI on LLMs and agents in PE companies.
</p>

<h2>SignalFrame Startup</h2>

<p>As technical co-founder and CTO of <a
	href="signal_frame_investors_2020.pdf">SignalFrame</a> (founded in
2015, acquired by PwC in 2021), I led a team of 20 engineers in building a
streaming temporal graph platform that processed data from ~1 billion IoT
devices monthly. Our daily stream consisted of ~100 million vertices with ~1
billion edges. On top of this knowledge graph we implemented advanced graph
embeddings for temporal and spatial analytics. Our products focused on
behavioral anomaly detection and structural forecasting.</p>

<h2>Research Background</h2>

<h3>Senior Researcher at <a href="https://informationsecurity.ethz.ch/">ETH Zurich's Security Institute</a> (2012-2015)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Database Security: Developed probabilistic attack prevention for SQL databases using Bayesian networks</li>
<li>Distributed Systems Monitoring: Created metric temporal logics for handling compromised and incomplete system logs (Google collaboration)</li>
<li>Decentralized Authorization: Built formal verification tools for complex authorization policies and authentication systems (Kaba Security collaboration)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ph.D. in Computing, <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">Imperial College London</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed soft symbolic AI models using multi-valued and probabilistic logics</li>
<li>Created adaptive security models for decision-making under system failures</li>
</ul>
