### About

I am the technical co-founder of [SignalFrame](https://signalframe.com">SignalFrame),
where I lead the design and implementation of our geo-temporal graph platform and analytics. 
My areas of interest include distributed streaming systems, information retrieval, runtime monitoring, 
knowledge base construction, formal and probabilistic security models, anomaly detection, non-monotonic AI, 
and applications of machine learning to graph analytics.  

My software management processes and codebase layerings are primarily rooted in
Parnas' layered virtual-machines and information-hiding principles. I refuse to
work on projects where I am not allowed to build iterative models and
deploy fast: working on complex systems requires a process of exploration and discovery.

While at SignalFrame, my technical focus (coding and design) has been on:

- Embeddings and data structures for temporal graphs
- Streaming framework with feedback loops in Go language
- Distributed graph query system in Go language
- Multi-agent classification system in Python and Scala ML stacks
- Knowledge-base with Markovian semantics
- Monitoring and automated recovery for Kubernetes services

Prior to SignalFrame, I was a senior researcher at [ETH Zurich's Security Institute](https://informationsecurity.ethz.ch/):

- Database Security and Privacy – designed mechanisms to prevent probabilistic
attacks on SQL DBs. Our enforcement algorithm was a Bayesian network synthesized from 
a probabilistic logic model and attack priors.

- Distributed Systems Monitoring (with Google) –  worked on metric temporal
logics for streaming algorithms to cope with missing and compromised
event logs. 

- Decentralized Authorization Systems (with Kaba Security) – developed trust
management algorithms (ala Microsoft’s SPKI and OAuth2) for policy compositions
and infrastructure failures. We also built policy verification tools based on
automated theorem provers. 


I received a PhD in Computing from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing)
where I developed a soft symbolic model, based on multi-valued logics, to ensemble decisions
from unreliable and mutually-conflicting data sources. We applied it to securing pervasive medical
workflows, as part of the EU-FP7 programme.
