<h2>Srdjan Marinovic</h2>

<p>
I'm a computer scientist interested in graph analytics, symbolic and deep learning AI, and distributed systems. With focus on building trustworthy, reliable, and scalable systems, I bridge the gap between research and practical engineering solutions. 
</p>

<p>
As Tech-and-Innovation Director at PwC, I drive the development of enterprise-scale AI and cloud solutions that combine the power of knowledge graphs, machine learning, and federated data platforms. My approach emphasize rapid iteration and shipping early to turning complex technical challenges into solutions with immediate business and ROI impact.
</p>

<p>
Current focus areas at PwC:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/products/signal-graph.html">Signal Graph "Operational AI" Platform</a> - Leading the development of an advanced analytics platform that transforms streaming time-series data into actionable insights. Our system combines LLMs with knowledge graph platforms to provide reliable, context-aware operational intelligence. A key innovation is our symbolic post-processing layer, which ensures the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated insights.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/alliances/microsoft/azure/smart-venue/smart-venues-solution.html">Smart Venues Solution</a> - Architecting next-generation venue management systems that leverage IoT data and advanced analytics to enhance operational efficiency and user experience.
</li>
<li>
Monitoring ROI of LLMs in Software Development - We developed a methodology and a set of tools to monitor and measure LLMs' reliability and efficacy when deployed across developers and different tasks in code generation. In our experience, moving from PoCs to large-scale deployments and production requires a new set of tools and trainings. 
</li>
<li>
Passive Organizational Network Analysis - We use Graph-based Machine Learning models on top of communication networks (chat, email, calendars)
to understand the impact of policies on employees and informal employee networks. This tool delivers organic insights into how teams operate, and how new-hires as well as established organizational influencers change over time.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have served as an ML/data advisor to <a href="https://futurae.com">Futurae</a> on
<a href="AMLD_Presentation.pdf">fraud-detection</a> and adaptive-authentication models. 
In 2020, I worked with <a href="https://fibr.com">Fibr Bank</a>
to implement an AWS-based data lake solution with strong integrity and lineage requirements.
</p>

<p>
From 2015 to 2021, I was the technical co-founder and the CTO of <a href="signal_frame_investors_2020.pdf">SignalFrame</a>. PwC acquired the company in 2021.
My team of ~20 engineers (UI, mobile, backend, ML) built a streaming temporal graph platform.
Our system collected data from ~1 billion IoT devices per month, and ingested ~100 million vertices with ~1 billion edges per day.
The platform built graph embeddings for temporal and spatial predictive analytics. The practical applications centred around behavioral anomaly detection, and structural forecasting.
My technical work was focused on:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Temporal graph analytics</li>
<li>Streaming framework with feedback loops (Golang)</li>
<li>Distributed graph query system (Golang)</li>
<li>Graph-pattern classifiers (Py and Scala)</li>
<li>Knowledge-base with Markov semantics</li>
<li>Monitoring and automated recovery of Kubernetes services</li>
</ul>

<p>
Prior to SignalFrame, from 2012 to 2015,
I was a senior researcher at <a href="https://informationsecurity.ethz.ch/">ETH Zurich's Security Institute</a>:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>
Database Security and Privacy – preventing probabilistic
attacks on SQL DBs. Our algorithm used a Bayesian network synthesized from
a probabilistic logic model and attack priors to prevent information leakage from federated attackers.
</li>

<li> Distributed Systems Monitoring (with Google) –  metric temporal
logics and streaming algorithms that overcome handle missing and compromised
system logs.
</li>

<li>
Decentralized Authorization Systems (with Kaba Security) – tools to formally
specify and verify authorization policies in decentralized settings. Our language captures
ABAC, authorization, delegations, and policy compositions. The tools can find policy bugs, inconsistencies, and over-permissive behaviours.  
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In 2012, I received a PhD in Computing from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">Imperial College London</a>.
I developed a soft symbolic AI model (based on multi-valued and probabilistic logics) to reason over unreliable and mutually-conflicting inputs.
We applied this model to specify and verify adaptive security models that make decisions under various failures.
