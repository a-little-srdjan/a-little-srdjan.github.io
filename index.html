<h2> Srdjan Marinovic </h2>
<h3> About </h3>
<p>
I am the CTO and a technical co-founder of a DC startup <a href="https://signalframe.com">SignalFrame</a>,
where I lead the design and implementation of our spatio-temporal graph platform. 
My areas of interest include distributed streaming systems, information retrieval, runtime monitoring, 
formal and probabilistic security models, anomaly detection, non-monotonic AI, 
and application of machine learning to graph analytics.  
</p>
<p>
While at SignalFrame, my technical focus has been on:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Data structures for temporal graphs</li>
<li>Streaming framework with feedback loops</li>
<li>Decentralized and distributed graph query system</li>
<li>Temporal graph embedding algorithm</li>
<li>Spatio-temporal analytics using graph representations</li>
<li>Knowledge-base updated my a multi-agent learning system</li>
<li>Automated infrastructure monitoring and recovery</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have set up our software development processes based on Parnas' layered-codebase and 
information-hiding principles. Our engineering culture centres around empowerment, 
learning, and empathy.
</p>
<p>
Prior to SignalFrame, I worked as a senior researcher at <a href="https://informationsecurity.ethz.ch/">ETH Zurich's Security Institute</a>.
I worked on
<ul type="disc">
<li>
Database Security and Privacy – designed mechanisms to prevent probabilistic
attacks on SQL DBs. Our enforcement algorithm was a Bayesian network synthesized from 
a probabilistic logic model and attack priors.
</li>
<li> Distributed Systems Monitoring (with Google) –  worked on metric temporal
logics for streaming algorithms to cope with missing and compromised
event logs. 
</li>
<li>
Decentralized Authorization Systems (with Kaba Security) – developed trust
management algorithms (ala Microsoft’s SPKI and OAuth2) for policy compositions
and infrastructure failures. We also built policy verification tools based on
automated theorem provers. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I received a PhD in Computing from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">Imperial College London</a> 
where I developed a soft symbolic model, based on multi-valued logics, to ensemble decisions
from unreliable and mutually-conflicting data sources. We applied it to securing pervasive medical
workflows, as part of the EU-FP7 programme.</p>
