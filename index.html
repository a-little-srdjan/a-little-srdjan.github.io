<h2> Srdjan Marinovic </h2>
<h3> About </h3>
<p>
I am a computer scientist with enginering experience
in startups. My areas of interest are distributed streaming systems,
information retrieval, runtime verification, knowledge bases, formal security models, non-monotonic AI,
and applications of ML to graph analytics.
</p>

<p>
My software architectures are inspired by Parnas' information-hiding principles and layered virtual machines.
My teams build iterative models and deploy fast: building complex systems is a process of exploration and discovery.
</p>

<p>
I serve as an ML advisor to <a href="https://futurae.com">Futurae</a>, where I am invloved 
with fraud-detection and adaptive-authentication models.
</p>

</p>
I was the technical co-founder and the CTO of <a href="https://signalframe.com">SignalFrame</a> (acquired by PwC in 2021).
My team of 20 engineers (UI, mobile, backend, ML) and I built a streaming temporal graph platform.
Our system collected data from 1 billion IoT devices per month, and ingested ~100 million vertices with ~1 billion edges per day.
The platform built graph embeddings in a streaming mode for temporal and spatial predictive analytics. 
</p>

<p>
My technical work was mostly focused on:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Temporal graph embeddings</li>
<li>Streaming framework with feedback loops (Golang)</li>
<li>Distributed graph query system (Golang)</li>
<li>Graph-pattern classifiers (Py and Scala)</li>
<li>Knowledge-base with Markov(-ish) semantics</li>
<li>Monitoring and automated recovery of Kubernetes services</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to my technical work, I regularly presented our products to our board and customers.
</p>

<p>
Prior to SignalFrame,
I was a senior researcher at <a href="https://informationsecurity.ethz.ch/">ETH Zurich's Security Institute</a>:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>
Database Security and Privacy – preventing probabilistic
attacks on SQL DBs. Our algorithm used a Bayesian network synthesized from
a probabilistic logic model and attack priors.
</li>

<li> Distributed Systems Monitoring (with Google) –  metric temporal
logics and streaming algorithms that handle missing and compromised
system logs.
</li>

<li>
Decentralized Authorization Systems (with Kaba Security) – tools to formally
verify security models and their compositions in decentralized settings.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I received a PhD in Computing from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">Imperial College London</a>
where I developed a soft symbolic AI model. Based on multi-valued logics, it ensembled decisions
from unreliable and mutually-conflicting data sources. This model allowed us to build adaptive security models with
continous monitoring and policy evaluation.</p>
