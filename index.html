<h3> About </h3>
<p>
I am a technical co-founder of a DC-based startup <a href="https://signalframe.com">SignalFrame</a>,
where I lead the design and implementation of our spatio-temporal graph platform and algorithms. 
My areas of interest include distributed streaming systems, information retrieval, runtime monitoring, 
trust management, anomaly detection, non-monotonic AI, 
and application of machine learning to graph analytics.  
While at SignalFrame, my technical focus has been:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Data structures for temporal graphs</li>
<li>Graph data storage design</li>
<li>Streaming framework with feedback loops</li>
<li>Decentralized and distributed graph query system</li>
<li>Temporal graph embedding algorithm and analytics</li>
<li>Knowledge based founded on multi-agent continuous learning</li>
<li>Automated infrastructure monitoring and recovery</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have set up our software development guidelines and processes founded in Parnas' layered-codebase principles. 
Finally, I have contributed to VC pitches, product development and sales,
and played an active part in establishing relationships with our customers.
</p>
<p>
Prior to SignalFrame, I worked as a senior researcher at <a href="https://informationsecurity.ethz.ch/">ETH Zurich's Security Institute</a>.
I worked on
<ul type="disc">
<li>
Database Security and Privacy – designed mechanisms to prevent probabilistic
attacks on SQL DBs. We relied on a mixture of Bayesian models
and logic models to develop an enforcement algorithm.  </li>
<li> Distributed Systems Monitoring (with Google) – developed metric temporal
logics to build streaming algorithms that operate under missing and compromised
streaming events (logs). 
</li>
<li>
Decentralized Authorization Systems (with Kaba Security) – designed trust
management algorithms (ala Microsoft’s SPKI and OAuth2) for policy compositions
and infrastructure failures. We also built policy verification tools based on
automated theorem provers. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I received a PhD in Computing from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">Imperial College London</a> 
where I developed a formal symbolic model, based on multi-valued logics, to ensemble decisions
from unreliable and mutually-conflicting data sources. We applied it to build secure pervasive medical
workflows, as part of the EU-FP7 programme.</p>
