<h2> Srdjan Marinovic </h2>
<h3> About </h3>
<p>
I am a computer scientist with a research background and applied enginering experience
in startups. My areas of interest include distributed streaming systems,
information retrieval, runtime verification, knowledge bases, formal security models, non-monotonic AI,
and applications of ML to graph analytics.
</p>

<p>
My software architectures are inspired by
Parnas' information-hiding principles and layered virtual machines.
My teams and I build iterative models and
deploy fast: building complex systems is a process of exploration and discovery.
</p>

<p> I serve as an ML advisor to <a href="https://futurae.com">Futurae</a>.
I provide practical and hands-on assistance in building authentication methods that adapt
to users' usage patterns.
</p>

</p>
I am the technical co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://signalframe.com">SignalFrame</a> (acquired by PwC in 2021).
We developed a temporal graph platform to ingest ~100 million vertices with ~1 billion edges per day.
The platform built their embeddings in a streaming mode for temporal and spatial similarity analysis
and predictive analytics. My technical contributions (both in terms of code and design) are:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>(Vertex) Embeddings for temporal graphs,</li>
<li>Streaming framework with feedback loops (Golang),</li>
<li>Distributed graph query system (Golang),</li>
<li>Multi-agent classification system (Py and Scala),</li>
<li>Knowledge-base with Markov(-ish) semantics,</li>
<li>Monitoring and automated recovery of Kubernetes services.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Prior to SignalFrame,
I was a senior researcher at <a href="https://informationsecurity.ethz.ch/">ETH Zurich's Security Institute</a>:
<ul type="disc">
<li>
Database Security and Privacy – preventing probabilistic
attacks on SQL DBs. Our algorithm used a Bayesian network synthesized from
a probabilistic logic model and attack priors.
</li>
<li> Distributed Systems Monitoring (with Google) –  Developed metric temporal
logics and streaming algorithms that handle missing and compromised
system logs.
</li>
<li>
Decentralized Authorization Systems (with Kaba Security) – Developed tools to formally
verify security models and their compositions in decentralized settings.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I received a PhD in Computing from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">Imperial College London</a>
where I developed a soft symbolic AI model, based on multi-valued logics, to ensemble decisions
from unreliable and mutually-conflicting data sources. We applied it to securing pervasive medical
workflows, as part of the EU-FP7 programme.</p>
