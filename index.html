<h2> Srdjan Marinovic </h2>
<h3> About </h3>
<p>
I am the technical co-founder of <a href="https://signalframe.com">SignalFrame</a>,
where I lead the design and implementation of our geo-temporal graph platform and analytics. 
My areas of interest include distributed streaming systems, information retrieval, runtime monitoring, 
knowledge base construction, formal and probabilistic security models, anomaly detection, non-monotonic AI, 
and applications of machine learning to graph analytics.  
</p>
<p>
My software management processes and codebase layerings are primarily rooted in
Parnas' layered virtual-machines and information-hiding principles. I refuse to
work on projects where I am not allowed to build iterative models and
deploy fast: working on complex systems requires a process of exploration and discovery.
</p>
<p>
While at SignalFrame, my technical focus (coding and design) has been on:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Embeddings and data structures for temporal graphs</li>
<li>Streaming framework with feedback loops in Go language</li>
<li>Distributed graph query system in Go language</li>
<li>Multi-agent classification system in Python and Scala ML stacks</li>
<li>Knowledge-base with Markovian semantics</li>
<li>Monitoring and automated recovery for Kubernetes services</li>
</ul>
<p>
Prior to SignalFrame, I was a senior researcher at <a href="https://informationsecurity.ethz.ch/">ETH Zurich's Security Institute</a>:
<ul type="disc">
<li>
Database Security and Privacy – designed mechanisms to prevent probabilistic
attacks on SQL DBs. Our enforcement algorithm was a Bayesian network synthesized from 
a probabilistic logic model and attack priors.
</li>
<li> Distributed Systems Monitoring (with Google) –  worked on metric temporal
logics for streaming algorithms to cope with missing and compromised
event logs. 
</li>
<li>
Decentralized Authorization Systems (with Kaba Security) – developed trust
management algorithms (ala Microsoft’s SPKI and OAuth2) for policy compositions
and infrastructure failures. We also built policy verification tools based on
automated theorem provers. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I received a PhD in Computing from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">Imperial College London</a> 
where I developed a soft symbolic model, based on multi-valued logics, to ensemble decisions
from unreliable and mutually-conflicting data sources. We applied it to securing pervasive medical
workflows, as part of the EU-FP7 programme.</p>
